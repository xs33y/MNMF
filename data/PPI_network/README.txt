	for example:

	13319 14537 0

	It means that protein 13319 and 14537 has a edge weighted 0.

	13319 1955 900

	It means that the edge has a heigh weight.

# label
	protein_id label_id
	
	label is determined by protein's gene group.
	
	Notice: When a gene belongs to more than one group, we random select one.
