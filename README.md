# MNMF

**The datasets used in origin paper can be download online. The PPI_network (edge weights are ignored here) is provided for testing the code.**    

Tensorflow implementation of 'Multi-Stage Network Embedding for Exploring Heterogeneous Edges'  
There may have slight difference between the codes and the descriptions of the paper, one can change it manually.      

## Introduction
A tensorflow implementation of MNMF, which is matrix factorization method for networks with heterogeneous edges.   


## Requirement
python 3.6, tensorflow 1.12.0   
a GPU with more than 12Gb memory   

## QA
